                                <p>
                                        Born on Titan, the second moon of Saturn, and unwittingly brought to earth 
                                        by an accident with a wormhole, I was adopted and raised by a pack of wolves 
                                        in the mountains of southwest Virginia.  After a chance encounter with 
                                        interstellar jazz musicians in my early teens, I gleaned my means of escape 
                                        and prospects of living my life as a musician.
                                </p> 
                                <p>
                                        From 1988 to 1992, I attended the Jazz Studies program at Virginia Commonwealth 
                                        Univerisity and did well in music but failed miserably at college because wolves 
                                        know nothing of higher education.  Through my professional experience I was 
                                        hired by Virginia Commonwealth Univerisity in 2005 to teach upright and electric 
                                        jazz bass, jazz improvisation, and small jazz ensembles.  In addition, I was hired 
                                        in 2011 to teach jazz bass at the University of Richmond.

                                        Another lifelong passion of mine has been tinkering with computer languages. I played with Basic in my early 
                                        teens on a Commodore Vic 20 and picked back up in my twenties with C and C++ and then 
                                        again in my early forties with Python. After 30 years of working self-employed as a 
                                        professional musician and in addition the last 14 years part-time adjunct faculty, I am looking for more 
                                        sustainable employment for my age by strengthening my skills in computer languages and 
                                        gaining the education and experience needed to diversify my employment opportunities.
